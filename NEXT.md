# NEXT — current state & kickoff

**Every item here is DONE or OPEN — there is no in-between, and nothing is deferred.** Work we decide
not to do is deleted from scope, never negated in place or held as deferred. A chunk that is
delivered but still has a real remainder stays OPEN, with the remainder recorded directly in its
own Open items entry (see the next paragraph for how). Prefer deleting a sentence to negating it.

**A bug found while fixing item A is A's remainder, not a new item.** Write it as a sub-clause of
A's own entry — what's fixed, what's still open — and leave A's checkbox open until the sub-clause
closes too, even if the sub-clause itself is deferred. Only promote it to a genuinely separate item
when it's actually unrelated to A's own scope (a different file or subsystem entirely), and say so
explicitly when you do. Closing A outright and opening a freshly-labeled item for the same discovery
is stalling dressed as progress: the open-item count looks flat or improved, but the record now hides
that A was never actually finished. (Landed 2026-08-01 after doing exactly this: a track's own
seed-fetch-retry fix got marked done and its test-coverage gap got logged as a brand new item,
until corrected.)

Living handover. Any session resumes from here. **Plan of record: the `PLAN_*.md` design docs** —
each states its own status in its opening lines; `archive/` holds the delivered ones. This file
holds ONLY what to do next. Completed work is not narrated here; `git log` and the
`reports/BENCHMARK_*.md` reports hold that record.

Session handles (inboxes): `tmct` and `tmct-hanoi`. See `~/.claude/inboxes/tmct.md` and
`~/.claude/inboxes/tmct-hanoi.md`.

Deploy target for `bash scripts/fast-deploy-web.sh <bucket> <dist>` (skips the CDK pipeline): bucket
`tmct-prod-prod-web-000868243177`, distribution `E1YEAO48PKAJHE`, `AWS_PROFILE=tmct-prod`. Full
clean path is a push to `main` with a remote — GitLab CI's `deploy:website` job.

## Open items

The method is the `news-feed-quality` skill
(`.claude/skills/news-feed-quality/SKILL.md`): run
(`node scripts/news-bench/capture-fixtures.mjs`, then
`node scripts/news-bench/run-live-cycle.mjs`), show every card whole in the
four-part form, fix the top item below, merge, repeat — never waiting on
pipelines. Position: iterations 1–13 run, all merged and pushed. Iteration 13's
feed reads 14 cards, 6 with real background and 5 thin, ranked by substance with
admission per source printed — NYT 8 of 8 with something to say, Hacker News 1
of 6. The syrian card is clean, `rescuers free quake victim` reads correctly,
the london card carries the phrasal fix, and the research rows come out in
content order rather than in the order the lookups returned. Harness note:
`run-live-cycle.mjs` starts fresh state each run, so the negative cache resets
and the same misses re-burn lookup slots per run; the deployed worker persists
state and does not.

The work list, ranked by value against the plan's target card.

1. [ ] **`localeCompare` over fact data, everywhere the sweep did not reach** —
   the closed item claimed ten sites. Ten is what was CONVERTED. Measured across
   `src/` after the guard landed: **116 calls in 39 files**, the largest being
   `tableau.mjs` (14), `syllogise.mjs` (13), `ask.mjs` (10), `domain.mjs` (8),
   `chat.mjs` (4, all over fact-derived data — two render union and enumeration
   sentences, one picks a someValuesFrom restriction, one lists taught action
   families), and `blocks.mjs` (1, ranking retrieved memory blocks by an id
   tiebreak, so two locales can retrieve different blocks). Not all 116 are fact
   data — viz files and browser entries sort labels — so the job is triage
   first, not a blind replace. `test/estate/fact-store-locale-compare.test.mjs`
   guards the five swept files and names in its own report what it misses;
   widen it as each group is cleared. The rule is in `fact-order.mjs`:
   codepoint, never `localeCompare`, because two readers on machines with
   different locales otherwise render different text from identical knowledge.

## Discipline

`CLAUDE.md` is the standing working model: the coordinator/background-sub-agent split (including
sub-agent git discipline, verifying a "waiting"/"completed" claim, and never resuming an
auto-removed worktree), the test blast radius (including the migration concept-sweep), the
versioning and push rules, and the repo-local identity. Read it there. This section holds only
what's specific enough to `tmct` that it doesn't belong in that general model.

- **Merging concurrent `chat.mjs` branches**: rebuild the ask bundle (it inlines chat readers, so
  it drifts on every reader change), rerun the pack-manifest check, and check for same-name
  top-level declarations across branches — esbuild's duplicate-symbol error at bundle time is the
  tell (two batches once both coined `spiderFlyContextAnswer`). Re-probe seed-content-dependent
  e2e pins against the real store after any seed-generation change — a raised seed cap can
  silently ground a demo's lookup term or break a source-adjacency pin.
- **`cd <repo-root>; pwd` as the literal first line of any merge-sequence Bash call.** The shell
  can carry a stale working directory across calls even with an explicit `cd` earlier in the same
  turn; a merge has run inside a sub-agent's worktree instead of the main checkout because of this.
- **Brief distinct naming when multiple agents extend the same shared test file.** Sibling
  content-authoring agents reliably collide on top-level `const`/`function` names even when their
  actual test content doesn't overlap — `git merge` can't auto-resolve that, only a manual rename
  can, so name the collision risk up front rather than reconciling it at every merge.
- **A fresh worktree has no `corpus/worlds/`, no `corpus/sprites/` and no ask bundle, and
  `node --test <file>` does not build them** — only the `npm run test:*` scripts do. So a targeted
  run in a new worktree fails tests that pass everywhere else, and the failure reads as a lane
  regression rather than a missing artifact (`spider-fly-turn.test.mjs` fails 7 of 17 at pristine
  HEAD for this reason alone). Every dispatch brief should say: run `node scripts/ensure-worlds-pack.mjs`,
  `node scripts/ensure-sprite-facts.mjs` and `npm run build:ask-bundle` before any `node --test`.
- **After closing an Open item, re-read the whole Open items section, not just your own diff.** A
  narrow text-replace edit's own match can end before a trailing item's text, leaving it
  unresolved and untouched for several commits even after the section's own summary line says
  "None open."

*Prior sessions' detailed handover (phases 0-13, releases 0.2.0 → 1.4.0) lives in this file's git
history, plus the `reports/BENCHMARK_<axis>_<version>.md` reports and `archive/`.*
