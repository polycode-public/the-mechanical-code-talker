# HANDOVER — current state & kickoff

**Every item here is DONE or OPEN — there is no in-between, and nothing is deferred.** Work we decide
not to do is deleted from scope, never negated in place or held as deferred. A chunk that is
delivered but still has a real remainder stays OPEN, with the remainder recorded in
`CLAUDES_LAST_RESORT_IS_TO_HIDE_THINGS_HERE_IDEALLY_YOU_COMPLETE_A_TASK_OR_NOT_BUT_DO_NOT_DEFER.md`.
Prefer deleting a sentence to negating it.

Living handover. Any session resumes from here. **Plan of record: the `PLAN_*.md` design docs** —
each states its own status in its opening lines; `archive/` holds the delivered ones. This file
holds ONLY what to do next. Completed work is not narrated here; `git log`, the `BENCHMARK_*.md`
reports and `CAPABILITIES_*.md` hold that record.

Session handles (inboxes): `tmct` and `tmct-hanoi`. See `~/.claude/inboxes/tmct.md` and
`~/.claude/inboxes/tmct-hanoi.md`; `mechanic.md` is retired.

## Version state (2026-07-18)

v2.5.4 published (CI publishes on a version bump on main); 2.5.5 in the working tree ahead of
the minor roll for the benchmark round.

Measured init sizes (fresh store, this machine): `init:large` 37,797 facts; `init:xl` 72,075
(16.6s); `init:xxl` 238,866 (38.5s). `init:xxxl` stays undocumented-as-code (bulk ConceptNet
download, not reachable from data in hand).

## Open items

The five-plan run of 2026-07-18 (`PLAN_25_BACKLOG`, `PLAN_DIALOGUE_ACTS`, `PLAN_GUESS_NUMBER`,
`PLAN_LEARN_ON_MISS`, `PLAN_SYLLOGIST` §2/§3/§4) is delivered and pushed — each plan doc records
its own per-section status, and `git log` holds the build record. What remains:

- **Teach-path predicate minting for prepositional verbs** (found in the run, operator decision):
  the general-verb teach glues a preposition into the object — "cat relates to milk" stores
  `cat mgx:relate "to milk"`. Mapping the closed "relates to" / "is related to" pair onto
  `mgx:relatedTo` would fix the garble and give the SKOS lane a natural teach phrasing; it
  changes teach-path predicate minting, so it needs the operator's word before it lands.
- **The endgame, in flight:** `PLAN_25_BACKLOG` §8.1's CHATBENCH expectation revision (the
  `be-honest-empty` superseding case) lands at this arc boundary; then all four benchmarks re-run
  at the new minor on the reformed ladders (TOOL-0…8, INF-1…8, FLOW-0…6, CEFR incl. P1/P2) with
  new cases covering everything this run fixed and added; then the capabilities audit
  (`SKILL_CAPABILITIES_AUDIT.md`); then each completed plan doc archives.

## Discipline

`CLAUDE.md` is the standing working model: the coordinator/background-sub-agent split, the test
blast radius, the versioning and push rules, and the repo-local identity. Read it there. This
section holds only what `CLAUDE.md` doesn't.

Three hard-won lessons, carried forward:

1. Background sub-agents sharing one working tree (no worktree isolation) can and did run
   destructive/shared git operations (`git stash`) meant only for the coordinator — recovered
   without loss, but now explicitly called out in every dispatch brief: sub-agents may only
   `git add <their own files>` + `git commit`, never `git stash`/`reset`/`checkout --`/`clean`.
   Also: the harness's permission system blocks `git commit` for *background* sub-agents entirely
   in some configurations (no live user to approve a permission-gated action) — the coordinator does
   the committing itself in the foreground when this happens, verifying `git status` immediately
   before every stage to avoid sweeping in another track's pre-staged files. (Re-proven 2026-07-15:
   a `git add -A` swept another session's untracked design doc into a commit — caught and amended
   out. List paths explicitly, or review `git status` line by line first.)

2. A background sub-agent's own final "completed" notification is not reliable proof it actually
   finished — an agent reporting a vague "I'll wait for the Monitor notification" as its terminal
   output is a sign of unfinished work, not a status update, even when its worktree in fact holds
   complete, real, committed work. Always verify via `git log`/`git status` on the agent's own
   worktree directly before deciding whether to resume it or treat it as done — trust the commits,
   not the prose. An agent stuck repeating the same "still waiting" message across multiple
   notifications is a sign to `TaskStop` it explicitly rather than keep resuming, once its worktree
   confirms the real work is already complete.

3. Never resume (`SendMessage`) a round whose worktree has already been auto-removed — relaunch
   fresh instead. This was observed twice: once an agent fell back to operating directly in the
   coordinator's own shared working tree; on a later occasion this went as far as checking out a
   brand-new branch on the shared worktree itself (caught immediately via `git branch
   --show-current` returning something other than `main`, no work lost). The rule: before resuming
   any stalled round, check `git worktree list` for its path
   — if it's gone, `TaskStop` that round and dispatch a fresh one instead, never `SendMessage` it
   back to life.

*Prior sessions' detailed handover (phases 0-13, releases 0.2.0 → 1.4.0) lives in this file's git
history, plus the `BENCHMARK_<axis>_<version>.md` reports and `archive/`.*
